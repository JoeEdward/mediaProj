			<h3 class="reviewhead">Apple Watch - Worth The Money?</h3>


			<p style="margin-left:10px;" class="lead">After using the watch since it came out back in April I feel like I can finally make a decision on whether it is worth 336 pounds of your hard erned cash.</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>"Our most personal device yet"</p>
				<small>
					<p>Tim Cook, CEO Apple Inc</p>
				</small>
			</blockquote>
			<p style="margin-left:10px;text-allign:justified;">Now first things first I believe that the Apple watch is a very good personal device that does not try to replace your phone but attemps to compiment it, an example of this would be when you get a text you can reply from a set of generated replys depending on the message content, this feature is not there to completely replace your phone and its keyboard but can help when on the move or when your phone is inaccesable.
			<br><br>
			Firstly I would like to discuss the main function of the watch, to tell the time, which it does very well in my opinion. As you may or may not know there is many different watchfaces to choose from, personally my favourite is the modular face which displays the time and other different "complications" like my calender and the weather. There is a good mix of digital and anolouge style watch faces some look very good and are all very easy to read and switch between. The other type of watch face is Apples new ways of telling the time like the one they show on the advert with the butterfly which flaps its wing every secound and is different breed every time you raise your wrist.
			<br><br>
			However there are a few bugs left in the OS which could be ironed out but dont seem to be leaving very soon. One of the fore mentioned bugs is sometimes app icons will just dissapear leaving the horrible xCode development icon which can be annoying but dosen't break any of the functions. There is also the occasional problem with the watch not detecting my wrist movement and turning the watch on which is very annoying this may be a problem that can be ironed out but if it can't it may be worth waiting for the Apple Watch 2 (Estimate Title).
