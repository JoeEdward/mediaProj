		<h3 class="reviewhead">Apple Watch - Worth The Money?</h3>


		<p style="margin-left:10px;" class="lead">After using the watch since it came out back in April I feel like I can finally make a decision on whether it is worth 336 pounds of your hard erned cash.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>"Our most personal device yet"</p>
			<small>
				<p>Tim Cook, CEO Apple Inc</p>
			</small>
		</blockquote>
		<p style="margin-left:10px;text-allign:justified;">Now first things first I believe that the Apple watch is a very good personal device that does not try to replace your phone but attempts to compliment it, an example of this would be when you get a text you can reply from a set of generated replies depending on the message content, this feature is not there to completely replace your phone and its keyboard but can help when on the move or when your phone is inaccessible.
			<br><br>
			Firstly I would like to discuss the main function of the watch, to tell the time, which it does very well in my opinion. As you may or may not know there is many different watchfaces to choose from, personally my favourite is the modular face which displays the time and other different "complications" like my calender and the weather. There is a good mix of digital and analog style watch faces some look very good and are all very easy to read and switch between. The other type of watch face is Apple's new ways of telling the time like the one they show on the advert with the butterfly which flaps its wing every second and is different breed every time you raise your wrist.
			<br><br>
			However there are a few bugs left in the OS which could be ironed out but don't seem to be leaving very soon. One of the aforementioned bugs is sometimes app icons will just disappear leaving the horrible xCode development icon which can be annoying but doesn't break any of the functions. There is also the occasional problem with the watch not detecting my wrist movement and turning the watch on which is very annoying this may be a problem that can be ironed out but if it can't it may be worth waiting for the Apple Watch 2 (Estimate Title).
			<br><br>
			The style of the watch is very nice but there is a few things that make the borders of the display stand out. A very nice thing is that the glass around the edge of the watch curves and connects to the metal case which gives a very sleek connected feel but the screen does not curve fully round with the glass, this is why most of the shown watchfaces are on black because when they are not the borders don't seem to merge and it ends up looking 'tacky', however this will probably be fixed when the second form of Apple Watch is released which may have a curved screen like the samsung galaxy edge.
			<br><br>
			I have tried one other smart watch before the Apple watch, that was the Moto 360 from Motorola which was circular instead of square and used the Android wear OS it was pretty good but there wasn't many apps available at the time and it had a problem in which the screen cracked on the first drop. On the other hand (Literally) I am yet to drop the apple watch as it is quite a bit easier to put on your wrist and i have got a whole technique for it now. The apps on watchOS seem to be in more ample supply than on android wear and most of my iPhone apps were automatically installed on my watch when i left the apple store.
			<br><br>
			In conclusion, I believe the Apple watch is one of the best smartwatch on the market and easily out performs its competition in functionality (Maybe not in looks) and if you want a smartwatch and you think it would be helpful to assist you in your life then I would strongly recommend going for the Apple watch.
